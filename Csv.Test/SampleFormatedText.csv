The initial steep rise can be attributed to large numbers of infections being detected and quarantined due to increased contact-tracing efforts.
This results in a ""drastic"" reduction in the slope soon after, as quarantined infected cannot spread the disease.","Countries: India; States:  Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal; Timeline: March 13th, 2020 - April 17th 2020",5/27/20

While the self-isolation strategy (Scenario 2) yielded approximately half as many case fatalities as the no intervention strategy, this showed the second highest number of cumulative case fatalities at 341,359.","Countries: Pakistan; Timeline: beginning on April 5th, 2020 run for one calendar year",5/28/20

Note that in the total quarantine, there will be more that 100 deceased since at this level of the disease more of the 50% of the population has been infected (case N = 0).",Closed population of 10000 inhabitants; Timeline: 180 days,5/28/20

For N = 2 we reduce the mortality of about 50% and for N = 0 the number of deceased is just 20.,Closed population of 10000 inhabitants; Timeline: 180 days,5/28/20

Similarly, starting active case finding at day 60 instead of day 30 would result in 5% less reduction in mortality and 15% less reduction in demand for health services (table 3).",Countries: Nepal; City: Kathmandu; Timeline: beginning on March 24,5/28/20
